                    Your starship crash lands on an uncharted planet.
                    The ship AI deployed protective measures, but hasn't
                    booted up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Communications have also been damaged, but with enough
                    repairs, a distress beacon can be sent.
                </p>
                <p>You stumble outside the ship a look the distance. A barren desert.</p>
                <p>
                    To the north-east, you find shapes reminiscent of buildings.
                    A canyon wall opens up at the south.

                    There's a a narrow path that leads deeper into the
                    bottom of the canyon. The rock wall is pocketed and
                    is composed of a sturdy rock substrate. You could
                    look from higher ground to survey the landscape.

                    Derelict solar arrays and minerals pumps are all strewn
                    across the area. This village was probably a seeding colony
                    from long ago.

                <p>
                    The surrounding homes all look weathered. At the center,
                    there are two large, three-storied buildings. They both read in
                    Old Terran, Research Lab and Warehouse.

                    stretches out for miles and miles.

                <p>
                    The cliffside continues up to even higher ground.
                    Further down along the plateau is a cave.

                    light becomes more and more scarce. You walk slowly,
                    touching the walls to feel for divergent paths.

                <p>
                    You come across a fork in the path. There is an slit
                    in the wall, just barely big enough for you, where you
                    can feel the wind passing through.
