                    Your starship crash lands on an uncharted planet.
                    The ship AI deployed protective measures, but hasn't
                    booted up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Communications have also been damaged, but with enough
                    repairs, a distress beacon can be sent.
                </p>
                <p>You stumble outside the ship a look the distance. A barren desert.</p>
                <p>
                    To the north-east, you find shapes reminiscent of buildings.
                    A canyon wall opens up at the south.
                </p>

                    There's a a narrow path that leads deeper into the
                    bottom of the canyon. The rock wall is pocketed and
                    is composed of a sturdy rock substrate. You could
                    look from higher ground to survey the landscape.

                    Derelict solar arrays and minerals pumps are all strewn
                    across the area. This village was probably a seeding colony
                    from long ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The surrounding homes all look weathered. At the center,
                    there are two large, three-storied buildings. They both read in
                    Old Terran, Research Lab and Warehouse.
