                    Your starship crash lands on an uncharted planet.
                    The ship AI deployed protective measures, but hasn't
                    booted up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Communications have also been damaged, but with enough
                    repairs, a distress beacon can be sent.
                </p>
                <p>You stumble outside the ship a look the distance. A barren desert.</p>
                <p>
                    To the north-east, you find shapes reminiscent of buildings.
                    A canyon wall opens up at the south.
                </p>
                <p>Where do you go?</p>
